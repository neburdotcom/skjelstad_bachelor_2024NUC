# RUBEN SKJELSTAD BACHELOR PROJECT 2024
## Supervisor: Barry Irwin

This is the script used for my bachelors project 2024

In the scripts folder there are 3 scripts, one for the Durumeric Definition of a scan, one for the case studies done in Chapter 5 and one for plotting geographical maps of benign/malicious countires.
There is a readme in each of the directories to explain furhter.

--------------------------------

ip,actor.txt is a collection of IPs related to known benign actors, NOTE: IPs are not fully verified as belonging to the specified entities; they were sourced from greynoise.io.

The csv folder contains data generated by the two scripts in /scripts directory. One compressed zip file for each case study.

------------------------------------

Thanks to Greynoise.io for VIP access to their service and SANREN for providing the PCAP files.
